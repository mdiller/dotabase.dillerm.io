# dotabase-web-v3

This project is a website for browsing the data extracted and formatted from the game Dota 2 into my [dotabase]() project/library. This is my third (and I think best) iteration of this frontend, is powered by Vue, and takes some of the best features from the old versions of dotabase-web.
